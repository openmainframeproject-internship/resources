# Open Mainframe Project Mentorship Program

The Open Mainframe Project is intended to serve as a focal point for deployment and use of Linux and Open Source in a mainframe computing environment. The Project intends to increase collaboration across the mainframe community and to develop shared tool sets and resources. Furthermore, the Project seeks to involve the participation of academic institutions to assist in teaching and educating the mainframe engineers and developers of tomorrow.

Through the Open Mainframe Project Mentorship Program, mentees will be able to....

- Expand their knowledge of mainframe technology
- Help contribute to open source projects that will make it easier for these infrastructure applications to run on mainframe.
- Learn crucial skills for a intern to be successful in a technology role within today's enterprise, including but not limited to project planning, communication, problem solving, and scoping.
- Be exposed to potential employers which help them transition into their career path successfully.
