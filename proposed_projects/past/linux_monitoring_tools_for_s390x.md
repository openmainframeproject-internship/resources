# Ensure popular Linux management tools can work on s390x

## Description

A key inhibitor towards moving to Linux on z Systems is the objection from administrators, developers and users that the management tools are not what they are used to on the x86 platform.  This project would be to identify a set of popular/ubiquitous open source tools that can be first, certified for Linux on z Systems and second, enhanced to take advantage of, monitor, manage the distinctive qualities of the z Systems platform (e.g. virtual network between the guests running in the same hypervisor instance, hipersockets).  The updated versions of these tools would be contributed back to their projects.


## Additional Information

A couple of lists of 'popular tools' are in these articles:

  * http://www.infoworld.com/article/2683857/network-monitoring/article.html
  * https://blog.serverdensity.com/80-linux-monitoring-tools-know/
  * https://www.linuxtechi.com/open-source-server-network-monitoring-tools-for-linux/

## Desirable Skills

Skills would be aligned to the languages and disciplines of the selected tools, but would likely need C/C++/Java coding skills, build and packaging for Linux, some mainframe skill (but could be obtained through mentoring and study)

## Expected Outcome

Open source tools updated, certified and contributed back to their projects

## Difficultly

*Easy/Medium* - depending on the tools chosen

## Mentors
